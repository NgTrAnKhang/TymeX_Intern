App overview
	-Question 1: I developed an app using Android Kotlin that allows users to input an integer representing an amount in USD. The app automatically converts this amount into the selected currency using live exchange rates. It provides real-time updates without requiring the user to press any buttons, ensuring a smooth and effortless experience.
	-Question 2:
		Question 2.1: This functionality includes a model that displays a default inventory list, calculates the total inventory value, and identifies the most expensive product. Users can also search for specific products (e.g., "Headphones") to determine their availability, and the inventory list is sorted by price in descending order and quantity in ascending order.
		Question 2.2: Here, users input the size of an array, and the program generates random numbers from 1 to n+1, subsequently identifying any missing numbers from the generated array.
Step to build and run
	Question 1 app: You can open the file in Android Studio then just build and run it on Android Virtual Device or physical device.
	Question 2 app:you can open it in Visual Studio then in the Program.cs file build and run it.Or click on the file name Question2.sln to run.
Challenges
	I completed my test in Flutter but after checking the test requirements I was confused about some requirements so I sent an email to get more clarity. When I received the email response I knew that I had to use Android Kotlin in question 1 so I had to start over from the beginning. This took me about a day from sending the email and receiving the response.Honestly, after 1 year of using Flutter, when I returned to Android, it took me a few hours to review what I had learned, but I found everything was still fine.
